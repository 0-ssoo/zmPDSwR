Setting up the spirals data as an example classification problemlibrary('kernlab')
data('spirals')  	# Note: 1 
sc <- specc(spirals, centers = 2) 	# Note: 2 
s <- data.frame(x=spirals[,1],y=spirals[,2],
   class=as.factor(sc)) 	# Note: 3 
library('ggplot2')
ggplot(data=s) +
   geom_point(aes(x=x,y=y,
      shape=class,color=class)) +
   coord_fixed() 	# Note: 4 

# Note 1: 
#    Load the kernlab kernel and support vector 
#   machine package and then ask that the included example "spirals" be made 
#   available.  

# Note 2: 
#    Use kernlabâ€™s spectral clustering routine 
#   to identify the two different spirals in the example dataset.  

# Note 3: 
#    Combine the spiral coordinates and the 
#   spiral label into a data frame.  

# Note 4: 
#    Plot the spirals with class labels.
