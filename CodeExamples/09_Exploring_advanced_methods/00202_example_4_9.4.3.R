Shifting decision point to

print(with(spamTest,table(y=spam,glPred=pred>sameCut))) 	# Note: 2

# Note 1: 
#    Find out what GLM score threshold has 162 
#   examples above it.  

# Note 2: 
#    Ask the GLM model for its predictions that 
#   are above the threshold. Weâ€™re essentially asking the model for its 162 best 
#   candidate spam prediction results.
